# Description

Hey!
[joemidi](https://github.com/joemidi) here. I was looking for a way to create a new project template on top of [LekoArts](https://www.lekoarts.de) [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) Theme whilst maintaining the same content/project folder structure.

I'm using [react-photo-gallery](https://github.com/neptunian/react-photo-gallery) to display the gallery from data gathered by the GraphQL query.
